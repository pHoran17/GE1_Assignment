An audio visualizer made in Unity that procedurally generates visual elements based on data from an audio track.
The design of the visualizer has been inspired by the form factors of vinyl records. The intent for this visualizer is gather data such as rms values from an audio track and to use this data for the generation of varied visual elements. These visual elements will be displayed in a large circle that will be generated both vertically and horizontally. The visuals will rotate appropriately much like a vinyl record with adjustable rotation speeds.

The basis for the visualizer will come from Youtube tutorials such as the ones listed below. I intend to build upon these with unique aspects such as the aformentioned variable rotation and a variety of different visual designs.

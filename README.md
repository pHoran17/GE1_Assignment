## GE1_Assignment
I created an audio visualizer in Unity that procedurally generates visual elements based on data from an audio track. 
Different aspects of the visualizer update based on specific factors. For example, some parts of the visualizer utilise a buffer to provide smooth reductions in their scaling
There is a camera that allows the user to move around the scene with a controller to view parts of the visualizer up close. 

###### Description of what you did.
I began the development of this project by researching the implementation of audio visualizers in Unity with various Youtube tutorials.
Portions of the visualiser were created with resources from Youtube tutorials linked below along with an example from a lecture. 

###### What you are most proud of about the assignment.
I am proud of how each part compliments each other however if I had to pick one portion in particular, 
it would be the ceiling portion of the visualiser. It was very satisfying to get that fully working as intended. 

###### What resources were useful for you (websites, tutorials, assets etc).
The following resources proved to be very useful for the development of this visualizer:
[Audio Visualization - Unity/C# Tutorial [Part 5 - Adding Buffers]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEUuC3LQnzs)
[Unity 5 Visualise Audio Spectrum - Unity 3D[Tutorial][C#]](https://youtu.be/wtXirrO-iNA)
